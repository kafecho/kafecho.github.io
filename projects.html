        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Software is a general purpose tool and can be used for solving many problems. For the past 8 years, I’ve mostly worked on software applied to broadcast technology (and mostly on back-end system to aid video production). Here are some of the work and hobby projects I’ve been involved with recently.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.soundcode.co.za/elm-beats-demo"><strong>Elm Beats</strong></a> This is a simple drum machine that is mostly written in <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>. This project is heavily inspired by this <a href="https://learningmusic.ableton.com/">Ableton project</a> which also uses Elm, but mostly for the UI layer. My version uses Elm for almost everything (including the audio scheduling). It only uses 3 JavaScript ports to manage the audio clock, decode audio sample and play audio sample at a precise point in time. The source code for the app is on <a href="https://github.com/kafecho/elm-beats">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://s-a-m.com/products/go!-browser-based-timeline-video-editor/c-24/p-188"><strong>SAM Go!</strong></a> <strong>Go!</strong> is an innovative web-based video editing product which is 100% based on Web standards. Please make sure to check the <a href="https://vimeo.com/202900375">demo video</a> as it is very interesting. I did a lot of JavaScript development focusing on the video and audio processing features.</p>

<p><a href="https://s-a-m.com/products/replayhighlights-livetouch/c-24/p-184"><strong>SAM LiveTouch</strong></a>. LiveTouch is a software and hardware product used for high quality replays for live sport events. I worked on a light-weight service which allows video operators to quickly search and share video fragments. The work was done with Scala, HTML5, JavaScript.</p>

<p><strong>Video Processing in Scala</strong>. I developped a bunch of tools (mostly Scala and Akka) for handling high bitrate commercial grade video streams (the stuff that comes out of a satellite feeds). I also did some research work in collaboration with BBC R&amp;D on using IP-based protocols for video content production. See <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/ip-studio">here</a> for more information on what the BBC has been doing in that space.</p>

<p><strong>DevOps stuff</strong>. I developped an extensive set of Ansible playbooks and roles for deploying clustered software components (CouchDB, SolrCloud, Zookeeper, HAProxy, Keepalivd) in highly resilient environments. This works includes the fully-automated deployment of monitoring stacks involving Icinga2, InfluxDB and Grafana. Most of the work is closed source, but I contributed back to the open source community with some work on Apache CouchDB.</p>

<p>I built a fully automated Continuous Delivery pipeline using Ansible, Maven, Jenkins, Vagrant. The pipeline implements the CD pipeline principles as described in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321601912?tag=contindelive-20">Jez Humble and Dave Farley’s Continuous Delivery book</a>.</p>
